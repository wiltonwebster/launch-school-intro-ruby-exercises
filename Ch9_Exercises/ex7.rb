#explain the major difference between Array and Hash

# Arrays and Hashes both contain ordered sets of data pairs. The major 
# difference between the two is in the way the data are paired. Arrays pair
# values with integer indices, while hashes pair values with keys (usually keys
# stored as symbols).
